 * The {@code StoreFileListener} interface provides a mechanism for receiving notifications when a store file is

 *
 * <p>The interface provides a default method for determining if the listener is active, and methods for handling
 * file acquisition and release events. It also defines a {@code NO_OP} listener that performs no actions.
 *
 * <p>Listeners implementing this interface may be notified asynchronously when files are acquired or released.
